# CVE check

Python script for searching or monitoring critical CVEs from the <a href=https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln> National Vulnerability Database </a> (NVD) feed ofered by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST). 

Thanks to @Amet13 for his <a href=https://github.com/Amet13/vulncontrol> vulncontrol.py script </a> from which I've reused a couple lines.
